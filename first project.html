           thirsty<em>crow</em>flew into a village in search of water.
             The crow flew over the houses, fields, and trees. ... The crow put his beak inside the pitcher<br> 
             but could not reach the water. The water level was too low,
              and the narrow opening prevented his neck from going all the way down.</p>

                The moral of this story - "Where there is a will there is
                 a way". In this very short story for small kids, once when
                  a clever crow is flying, it feels thirsty. It sees a pot
                   of water, but the water is too low inside the pot for 
                   the crow to reach.
